#polymorphism: one person, multiple behaviours

class ineuron:
    def students(self):
        print("print student details")
class class_type:
    def students(self):
        print("print the class type of students")
def ineuron_external(a):
    a.students()

s = ineuron()
j = class_type()
ineuron_external(s)
ineuron_external(j)


class
object
constructor
private
public
protected
abstraction: data hiding
encapsulation
polymorphsim: create commonn interface, which will be able acess.
package
module
method overridding




# def test(a,b):
#     return a+b
# print(test(3,4))
# print(test("sudh","kumar"))


For all the concepts that we have discussed in our class point by point you have to write
atleast 10 examples

you have to make sure that use ineuron studnets , class , class type , number of courses
, affiliates , blog, internship , jobs as a reference example
